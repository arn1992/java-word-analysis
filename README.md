this is the project of java word analysis. 

here i take 100 words from a text file. you can take as much as you can.then i check the word with a given sequence and produce the result.

For example: in now checking option if you give  "*u****" as input sequence then you can see that "public", "number" as a result.moreover,
if you give "*o*" then the programme search the entire text file and produce "hot","how","not","now","you" as a sorted order.
